# Changelog

All notable changes to candor are recorded here. Format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); candor is pre-1.0, so minor versions may include
behavioural changes (always in the soundness-increasing direction — see the §4 trust contract).

## [0.3.3] — 2026-06-10 (crates: candor-report / candor-classify / candor-scan, lockstep)

Republish so the crates.io artifacts carry the fixes committed after 0.3.2 (the published 0.3.2 had
diverged from the 0.3.2 source tree). Surfaced by a maximum-effort multi-agent `/code-review`.

### Fixed — precision / correctness

- **`candor-classify`: IPv6-aware policy host matching** — `host_part` now keeps a bracketed
  `[::1]:8080` host and a bare `2001:db8::1` intact instead of truncating at the first `:` (which had
  mangled IPv6 endpoints in `allow Net in <scope> <host>` rules into a useless prefix).
- **`candor-scan`: single-codepoint type idents** — the CamelCase test in `type_from_value_path` uses
  `chars().count()`, not byte `len()`, so a one-character non-ASCII type ident (`struct É;`) still
  counts as a single character (a snake/SCREAMING const still yields `None` — honest under-report).

report is bumped in lockstep (unchanged content) to keep the three crates' shared version and their
inter-crate `version =` dependencies resolvable on crates.io.

## [0.3.2] — 2026-06-10 (crates: candor-report / candor-classify / candor-scan, lockstep)

The "validated everywhere" release: 18 product fixes found by systematic validation (blackout screens,
report-vs-source A/B audits, query property harnesses, fuzzer extensions) since 0.3.1.

### Fixed — soundness / recall (the dangerous direction)

- **`src/build.rs` modules are scanned** (only the crate-root Cargo build script is skipped) — git2's
  `RepoBuilder` module had vanished entirely, so `Repository::clone` reported no `Net`.
- **Struct-literal bindings infer their type** (`let s = S;` / `let s = S{..};` — previously only
  annotated lets), CamelCase-gated; `Enum::Variant` types as the enum.
- **Classifier tiers added:** libcurl FFI (`curl_easy_perform`/send/recv/upkeep + multi pumps → Net)
  + the `curl` consumer crate rule; libgit2 submodule clone/update → Net; `std::path::Path`/`PathBuf`
  stat family → Fs (gix-dir, a directory walker, had reported zero Fs); DB verb dialects — rusqlite's
  canonical API (`query_row`/`query_map`/`execute_batch`/`prepare_cached`/`open`…) had classified
  PURE for consumers, plus `tokio_postgres::query_typed`, diesel `first`/`load_iter`, sqlx `fetch_many`.
- **Report fields:** `spec` (the contract version — required by SPEC §2.1), `unknownWhy`, `entryPoint`
  now emitted by the report crate (published 0.3.0/0.3.1 artifacts predated them).

### Fixed — precision / correctness

- **Callgraph sidecar completeness (SPEC §2.2):** every analyzed function is a key (uncalled leaves
  were invisible to `whatif`/`callers`, conflating "no callers" with "no such function").
- **Name-query matching ladder:** exact > segment-suffix > substring — a precise partial name
  (`Pricing::quote`) no longer silently widens a blast radius to substring cousins (`quote_bulk`).
- **`map` buckets crate-root free functions into `(root)`** per SPEC §6.1 (was one pseudo-module per
  function on flat crates).
- **`diff` fails loud on a prefix matching no reports** (a typo'd current path previously showed zero
  gains — silently passing a gained-effect gate).
- **The shared `CANDOR_POLICY` parser** (SPEC §6.2) — one canonical implementation for the gate,
  `whatif`, and the new `parsepolicy` dump; `deny Unknown <scope>` now parses everywhere.

### Added

- `PROVE-IT.md` — a self-experiment prompt an adopter's agent runs on their own repo (this release is
  its minimum version: earlier published binaries exhibit the since-fixed resolution bugs above).

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-08

The "enforce, soundly, at scale" release. candor goes from *describing* effects to **enforcing**
architecture-as-code across a whole workspace, makes "never silently under-reports" a set of
CI-enforced fuzzers instead of a hope, and ships a rigorously-measured demonstration that it changes
the code agents *ship*, not just what they report.

### Added — architecture-as-code policy (`cargo candor policy`)

- **Literal allowlists (AS-EFF-008).** `allow <Effect> [in <scope>] <value>…` constrains *which* values
  an effect may reach, checked against the **transitive** literal surface:
  - `allow Net … <host>` — network host allowlist ("billing may only talk to Stripe"), matched by hostname.
  - `allow Exec … <cmd>` — subprocess command allowlist ("build may only run git"), matched by basename.
  - `allow Fs … <path>` — filesystem path allowlist ("config may only read /etc/app"), matched by prefix.
  A model can't self-check these: the literal is buried in a deep, often cross-crate, callee.
- **Module-layering rules (AS-EFF-009).** `forbid <A> -> <B>` — a function in scope `A` must not
  transitively call into scope `B` (the dependency-direction boundary). Follows dependencies **across
  crates**, including ones laundered through a third crate (via per-crate `layerreach` sidecars written
  during the workspace enforce pass).
- **One-command workspace gate.** `cargo candor policy` now snapshots every crate then enforces with the
  siblings loaded, so cross-crate boundaries (effects, hosts, layering) hold in a single invocation.
  Gates on AS-EFF-006 / 008 / 009.
- **`CANDOR_REPORTS`** — a read-only cross-resolution prefix usable in enforcement modes.

### Added — effect detail in the report

- **`hosts` / `cmds` / `paths`** report fields: the statically-visible literal Net endpoints, subprocess
  commands, and filesystem paths a function reaches (the decidable subset; never a completeness claim).
  Propagated transitively and across crates.

### Added — soundness, now a gate

- **Adversarial soundness fuzzers**, all CI-enforced, all teeth-verified (reverting the relevant fix
  turns them red):
  - construction fuzzer — threads a known effect through every call form (closures, `dyn`, generic /
    boxed callbacks, `Arc<dyn>` arbitrary-self-type, macros);
  - cross-crate variant (lib→bin DefPathHash propagation);
  - dynamic oracle — runs each program under `strace` and asserts candor over-approximates the effects
    the kernel actually observed, plus a per-function attribution variant;
  - **drop fuzzer** — threads the effect through a `Guard`'s `Drop` wrapped in random container forms.
- **Implicit `Drop` edges.** candor now reads MIR `Drop` terminators and follows the dropped type's
  reachable local `Drop::drop` impls — including value-embedded fields **and** std owning containers
  (`Box`/`Vec`/`Rc`/`Arc`/`HashMap`/…). An effectful RAII guard (I/O on scope exit) is no longer
  silently dropped from the effect graph. (Found by the Bet 4 MIR spike; see `eval/bet4/FINDINGS.md`.)

### Added — evidence

- **Pre-registered outcome eval** (`eval/bet2/`): when a task tempts an agent to put I/O in a layer that
  must stay pure, candor took the **shipped** violation rate from ~80% to 0% (Fisher p<0.001). Two prior
  pre-registered nulls (floor effects) are reported honestly alongside.
- **Real-world validation** (`eval/realworld/`): the policy + detail features run on candor's own
  non-fixture code; literal extraction matches `build.rs`'s actual `git`/path I/O exactly.

### Changed

- **Policy scope matching now uses the crate-prefixed path** (`<crate>::<path>`), so a layering/allow/
  deny scope spelled as a **crate name** matches that crate's own functions instead of being a silent
  no-op. Module/type-name scopes are unaffected.
- Classifier: `tokio::process` → `Exec`; async runtimes; `time`/`fs_err`/`tempfile`/`glob`/`duct`/
  `dotenvy`; compiler diagnostic emission → `Log`; `rand` verb-gated.
- **crates.io-ready:** vendored `span_lint`, dropping the only git dependency (`clippy_utils`).
- Nightly pin is now auto-bumped weekly by `.github/workflows/nightly-bump.yml` (opens a reviewed PR).

### Fixed

- Soundness holes: `Box<dyn Fn>` called directly, non-local callbacks, and `dyn` behind a smart pointer
  (`Arc<dyn>`) are no longer reported pure; `parse_dph` ICE on a non-ASCII hash.
- Closure-flow: effects propagate through a named function passed as a callback.
- Tooling robustness: the source-freshness hash, the `settings.json` Stop-hook merge, and report
  discovery moved out of fragile (duplicated, drifted) shell into typed, unit-tested `candor-query`
  subcommands (`state`, `reports`, `merge-hook`). The guard no longer fails open; `install.sh` no longer
  risks clobbering a user's settings.

## [0.2.0]

The agent-facing baseline: per-function transitive effect inference, the v0.2 report envelope,
cross-crate propagation by `DefPathHash`, the `cargo candor` wrapper and `candor-query` CLI, the
CANDOR_STRICT / NO_AMBIENT / BASELINE / POLICY enforcement modes, and the Claude Code integration.
